</p>

A real-time memory game implemented on the STM32F103RB microcontroller using C and GPIO interrupts.  
Designed as a course project for ENSE 352, this system challenges users to mimic LED patterns through timed button presses, with difficulty increasing after each correct round.

## 🎮 Game Overview

- The game begins with a **Knight Rider-style LED animation**.
- A random LED sequence is generated and shown to the user.
- The user must replicate the sequence by pressing corresponding buttons.
- Each level adds one more step to the sequence.
- On success: the game progresses with a longer sequence.
- On failure: a unique **error animation** is played and the game ends.
- On completion: a **winning animation** sequence is triggered.

## 🔌 Hardware Overview

- **Microcontroller**: STM32F103RB  
- **IDE**: Keil uVision (C programming)  
- **Inputs**: 4 Buttons (using external interrupts)  
- **Outputs**: 4 LEDs (via GPIO)  
- **Timing**: SysTick timer used for delays and animation pacing
